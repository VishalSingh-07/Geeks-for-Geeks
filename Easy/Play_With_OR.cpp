/*
Play With OR

You are given an array arr[] of length n, you have to re-construct the same array arr[] in-place. The arr[i] after reconstruction will become arr[i] OR arr[i+1], where OR is bitwise or. If for some i, i+1 does not exists, then do not change arr[i].

Example 1:

Input :
n = 5
arr[] = {10, 11, 1, 2, 3}
Output :
11 11 3 3 3
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] or arr[1] = 11
At index 1, arr[1] or arr[2] = 11
At index 2, arr[2] or arr[3] = 3
...
At index 4, No element is left So, it will remain as it is.
New Array will be {11, 11, 3, 3, 3}.



Example 2:

Input :
n= 4
arr[] = {5, 9, 2, 6} 
Output :
13 11 6 6
Explanation:
At index 0, arr[0] or arr[1] = 13.
At index 1, arr[1] or arr[2] = 11.
At index 2, arr[2] or arr[3] = 6.
At index 3, No element is left So, it will remain as it is.
New Array will be {13, 11, 6, 6}.



Your Task:

You are required to implement the function game_with_number(), which takes an array arr, representing values at each index, and the size of the array n. The function should modify the elements of the same array arr[] in-place by replacing them with the values obtained by performing the bitwise OR operation on consecutive elements.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

//{ Driver Code Starts
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;


int* game_with_number(int arr[], int n);

int main()
{
    
    int t;cin>> t;
    while(t--)
    {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        int arr[n];
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
            cin>>arr[i];
        
        int *arr2;
        
        arr2 = game_with_number(arr, n);
        for(int i = 0;i < n; i++)
            cout << arr2[i] << " ";
        
        cout << endl;
        
    }

}

// } Driver Code Ends


// Optimized Approach
// Time complexity -> O(n) and Space -> O(1)
int* game_with_number(int arr[], int n)
{
    // Complete the function
    for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
    {
        arr[i]=arr[i]|arr[i+1];
    }
    return arr;
}
